# Contributing to the Open Source Data Diode
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Standard for Public Code
Contributions should follow the requirements set out in the criteria of the [Standard for Public code](https://standard.publiccode.net/). Reviewers will also be ensuring that contributions are aligned with the [values of public code](https://standard.publiccode.net/introduction.html#values-of-public-code).

## We Develop with GitHub
We use HitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
or follow one of the great free interactive courses in the
[GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/).

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively  your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache License 2.0 that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CyberInnovationHub-NLD/OpenSourceDataDiode-OSDD-/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Policy regarding sensitive information
Contributors must not upload sensitive information regarding users, their organization or third parties to the repository.

## Sign commits
Contributors may sign their commits and provide an email address, so that future contributors are able to contact past contributors with questions about their work.
